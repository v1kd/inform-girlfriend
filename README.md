# Inform girlfriend

> Works only on Mac with iPhone :(

Simple script to inform your girlfriend or wife that you are going to be late from your work

## How it works

The script would check your wifi connection name and if your laptop/desktop is connected to your company's wifi network, it would send a message using **iMessages** 

> You need to give permissions to your laptop to use iMessages to send and receive text messages

## Installation

```bash
npm install # or
yarn install
```

Add a cron tab entry to run every day at whatever time you wish to run
